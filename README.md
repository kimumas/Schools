### Data Science Project
In this project, I looked at SAT scores of hish schools, along with various demographic and other information about them.

The SAT, or Scholastic Aptitude Test, is a test that high schoolers take in the US before applying to college and that College uses the test score for admissions decisions. So, high schools are often ranked by their average SAT scores, and high SAT scores are considered a sign of how good a school district is.  
For the purpose of this project, I used data about New York public schools. Here are the links to all of the datasets I used:  
* [SAT scores by school](https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Education/2012-SAT-Results/f9bf-2cp4) — SAT scores for each high school in New York City.
* [School attendance](https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Education/School-Attendance-and-Enrollment-Statistics-by-Dis/7z8d-msnt) — attendance information on every school in NYC.
* [Math test results](https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Education/NYS-Math-Test-Results-By-Grade-2006-2011-School-Le/jufi-gzgp) — math test results for every school in NYC.
* [Class size](https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Education/2010-2011-Class-Size-School-level-detail/urz7-pzb3) — class size information for each school in NYC.
* [AP test results](https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Education/AP-College-Board-2010-School-Level-Results/itfs-ms3e) — Advanced Placement exam results for each high school. Passing AP exams can get you college credit in the US.
* [Graduation outcomes](https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Education/Graduation-Outcomes-Classes-Of-2005-2010-School-Le/vh2h-md7a) — percentage of students who graduated, and other outcome information.
* [Demographics](https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Education/School-Demographics-and-Accountability-Snapshot-20/ihfw-zy9j) — demographic information for each school.
* [School survey](https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Education/NYC-School-Survey-2011/mnz3-dyi8) — surveys of parents, teachers, and students at each school.
* [School district maps](https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Education/School-Districts/r8nu-ymqj) — contains information on the layout of the school districts, so that we can map them out.
### Data Cleaning
In the first part of this project, I consolidated those data into a single dataset and did a good amount of data cleaning.
Here, I used the pandas tools to load, clean, transform, merge, and reshape real-world data.
### Exploratory Data Analysis
In the second part of this project, I analyzed factors that correlated with the SAT scores, and did some exploratory visualization and analysis.
Here, I created scatter plots with matplotlib and interactive geographic visualization with folium.
