In this project, I looked at SAT scores of hish schools, along with various demographic and other information about them.
The SAT, or Scholastic Aptitude Test, is a test that high schoolers take in the US before applying to college and that College uses the test score for admissions decisions. So, high schools are often ranked by their average SAT scores, and high SAT scores are considered a sign of how good a school district is.
For the purpose of this project, I used data about New York public schools. Here are the links to all of the datasets I used:  
* [SAT scores by school](https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Education/2012-SAT-Results/f9bf-2cp4) â€” SAT scores for each high school in New York City.
